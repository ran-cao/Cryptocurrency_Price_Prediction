Developed machine learning models to predict Ethereum daily price returns with Python

### Problem Setup
Ethereum (ETH) price experienced a huge increase in 2018 and followed by a steady decrease.
Studying the trend of ETH price change would efficiently help to predict future ETH price and
make business strategies accordingly.

- The first part of the report focuses on the ARIMA
approach with ETH time series data from 2015/08/07 to 2020/01/16, extracted from Yahoo
Finance. After establishing the initial cryptocurrency price model, the goal is to find the trading
signals. 

- The second part covers how sensitive ETH prices are to bitcoin (BTC) by conducting a lead-led analysis.
